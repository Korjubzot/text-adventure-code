# text-adventure-code
Python code for a text adventure game

# Description

This is the code for a small game available on my [itch.io](https://korjubzot.itch.io/the-tower-a-text-adventure), written for fun in Python. You can find a more thorough description on the storefront - this is here for interview demonstrations.

# Installation

Although you *can* pull and run this code from Github, I'd recommend downloading the packaged files for Windows or MacOS on itch.io

# To Do

- Rework movement commands to function correctly outside of expected movements
- Fix the elseif nesting nightmare
